## My process

I started by first setting up my custom colors, fonts, and element styling. I then built out each section of the webpages by using TailwindCSS and focusing on a mobile-first design. After creating the mobile site, I then went on to do the tablet and desktop versions of the main page. I did the same process for the location.html page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

This was my first solo project after taking some courses about HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS. Overall, I am proud of how the website turned out. There were definitely some frustrating sections that I know I could have done better, and I hope to revisit this project down the road to make improvements. The hardest part was creating the hero section for desktop resolutions. The gradient of a black background, image background, and white background was extremely difficult for me to figure out while also making the logo half white and half black without using photoshop. I am happy with the solution I came up with; it took me way too long, and I know there is a better way to do it, but I still think it turned out to be decent. I learned that TailwindCSS is a great framework for creating sites even if they have difficult and challenging CSS. I originally stated this project with vanilla CSS, but I after trying it with Tailwind, I learned how much more organized the workflow was with it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I will continue to work on keeping my Tailwind classes concise and avoiding unnecessary classes or overlapping classes. I know there are elements in there that probably have classes that are redundant or unneeded, and I will definitely be focusing on making it "cleaner" as I continue to progress.
